# 🧭 AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) — Overview and Key Facts

## 📘 What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a **virtual network** within the AWS cloud that closely resembles a traditional on-premises data center network.  
It allows you to operate your own isolated section of the AWS cloud, with the benefits of **scalable infrastructure** and **cloud flexibility**.

> **Simplified Definition:**  
> A VPC is a virtual network or data center inside AWS that is dedicated to a single client (AWS account).

## 🔒 Isolation

- A VPC is **logically isolated** from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud.
- You can connect VPCs together using **VPC Peering** or **Transit Gateway**, but by default, they remain independent.

## ⚙️ VPC Limits and Quotas (Defaults)

| Resource | Default Limit | Scope | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **VPCs per Region** | 5 | Per AWS Region | This is a **default quota** and can be increased upon request. |
| **Subnets per VPC** | 200 | Per VPC | Can also be increased by AWS Support. |
| **Elastic IPs** | 5 | Per AWS Region | Quota can be increased by request. |

> ⚠️ These are **default quotas**, not hard limits.  
> You can request quota increases through the **AWS Service Quotas** console.

## 🧩 Automatically Created Components

When you create a **VPC**, AWS automatically creates the following components:

- **DHCP Options Set** — defines how instances receive DNS and other network configuration.
- **Network ACL (NACL)** — a default NACL that allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Security Group** — a default security group with permissive outbound rules.

> 📝 You can create additional custom components as needed (e.g., Internet Gateways, Route Tables, Custom NACLs, etc.).

## 🌍 Regional Scope

- A **VPC is confined to a single AWS Region**.
- However, a VPC can span **multiple Availability Zones (AZs)** within that Region.
- **VPCs cannot extend across Regions.**

---

## ✅ Summary

- A VPC provides a **customizable and secure virtual network** within AWS.
- It mimics a **traditional data center** but leverages the **scalability** and **flexibility** of cloud infrastructure.
- All network-level resources (subnets, IPs, routing, gateways) can be managed and configured as needed.
