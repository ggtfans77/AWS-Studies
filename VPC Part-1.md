Here’s a **cross-verification** of the statements from your note about Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), showing which are **correct**, which need nuance, and which are **inaccurate** or incomplete:

| *“A VPC is a Virtual Network or Data Centre inside AWS for one client.”*              | ✅ Largely correct. A VPC is a logically isolated virtual network “inside” the AWS cloud, intended for one account (or one client’s workload) by default. See AWS user-guide: “A VPC is a virtual data center in the AWS cloud.” ([polarsparc.com][1])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| *“It is logically isolated from Other Virtual N/W in the AWS Cloud.”*                 | ✅ Correct. The isolation of a VPC from other VPCs is an intended feature (unless explicitly connected via peering, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| *“Max 5 VPC can be created and 200 Subnets in 1 VPC.”*                                | ✅ Mostly correct. According to the official quotas: VPCs per Region default = 5 (adjustable). Subnets per VPC default = 200. ([AWS Documentation][2]) However: “Max 5 VPC” is a soft default and can be increased via request. The note didn’t mention the “adjustable” part. Also the “200 subnets” is a default, can be increased. So nuance is needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| *“We can allocate max 5 Elastic IP.”*                                                 | ✅ Correct in default state: Elastic IPs per Region default quota = 5. ([AWS Documentation][2]) Good to note: That is per Region (not per VPC) and you can request a higher quota.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *“Once we created VPC, DHCP, NACL and Security Group will be automatically created.”* | ✅ Partially correct. When you create a VPC: – A default DHCP options set is automatically associated. ([AWS Static][3]) – A default Network ACL (NACL) is created and automatically associated with the VPC. – A default Security Group is created for the VPC. AWS docs indicate: “Your VPC includes a default security group… You can’t delete this group.” ([AWS Documentation][4]) So yes, the components are automatically created *for the default setup*. But the note gives the impression that *every custom VPC creation* automatically creates all (DHCP, NACL, SG) – which is broadly correct. But details (e.g., route tables, internet gateway) vary. So statement is generally correct with minor nuance. |
| *“A VPC is Confined to an AWS Region and does not extend Between Regions.”*           | ✅ Correct. A VPC is regional. It cannot span AWS Regions. That is a key design limitation. For example: “A VPC can span all the Availability Zones in the same AWS Region, but cannot span Regions.” ([Repost][5])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Additional nuance / caveats worth adding

* The “5 VPCs per Region” and “5 Elastic IPs per Region” are default quotas **and can be increased** by requesting a quota increase from AWS. So saying “max 5” without mentioning “by default” or “unless increased” can be misleading.
* When you create a VPC, you do **not** automatically get subnets, internet gateway, route tables configured for public connectivity — these steps must be done explicitly (unless you are relying on the default VPC which AWS provides).
* The note says “200 subnets in 1 VPC” — yes default is 200, but if you request you may be able to increase (depending on region). Also you should design IP planning accordingly.
* The note mentions “DHCP, NACL and Security Group will be automatically created” — yes, but you might want to clarify that these are default ones (you can create custom ones too).
* The statement “VPC is a Virtual Network that Closely Resembles a traditional Networking … in your own data centre, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS” is more of a conceptual description, not a precise definition. It is correct as a teaching sentence but not from the documentation word-for-word.

### In summary

Your note is **mostly accurate**, with the caveat that some of the “max” numbers are default quotas (not hard immutable limits) and some automation steps have nuance. If you like, I can pull together a **“verified list of key AWS VPC defaults and quotas”** based on the latest AWS docs for study purposes. Would you like that?
